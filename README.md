Terremark Connector Extension
=============================

##Use Case

Elastically grow/shrink instances into cloud/virtualized environments. There are four use cases for the connector. 

First, if the Controller detects that the load on the machine instances hosting an application is too high, the terremark-connector-extension may be used to automate creation of new virtual machines to host that application. The end goal is to reduce the load across the application by horizontally scaling up application machine instances.

Second, if the Controller detects that the load on the machine instances hosting an application is below some minimum threshold, the terremark-connector-extension may be used to terminate virtual machines running that application. The end goal is to save power/usage costs without sacrificing application performance by horizontally scaling down application machine instances.

Third, if the Controller detects that a machine instance has terminated unexpectedly when the connector refreshes an application machine s`tate, the terremark-connector-extension may be used to create a replacement virtual machine to replace the terminated application machine instance. This is known as our failover feature.

Lastly, the terremark-connector-extension may be used to stage migration of an application from a physical to virtual infrastructure. Or the terremark-connector-extension may be used to add additional virtual capacity to an application to augment a preexisting physical infrastructure hosting the application.

##Installation

1. Clone the terremark-connector-extension from GitHub
2. Run 'ant package' from the cloned terremark-connector-extension directory
3. Download the file terremark-connector.zip located in the 'dist' directory into \<controller install dir\>/lib/connectors
4. Unzip the downloaded file
5. Restart the Controller
6. Go to the controller dashboard on the browser. Under Setup->My Preferences->Advanced Features enable "Show Cloud Auto-Scaling features" if it is not enabled. 
7. On the controller dashboard click "Cloud Auto-Scaling" and configure the compute cloud and the image.

Click Compute Cloud->Register Compute Cloud. Refer to the image below
